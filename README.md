# About
The goal of this analysis is to provide comprehensive insights into the operations and performance of a supermarket chain across multiple branches.

## Data Preprocessing 
In this project, I manipulated the supermarket dataset using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)in order to derive actionable insights into customer behavior, sales patterns, and payment trends across different branches. Below are the key steps undertaken in this analysis:

1. **Branch Sales Analysis**: [Link to Query on GitHub](https://github.com/Ayoub-Harimza/Supermarket-Analysis/blob/main/SQL%20Files/SQLQuery1.sql)
   - Calculates total sales, average sales per day, and the number of customers for each branch.

2. **Branch Product Analysis**: [Link to Query on GitHub](https://github.com/Ayoub-Harimza/Supermarket-Analysis/blob/main/SQL%20Files/SQLQuery2.sql)
   - Analyzes product sales distribution across branches, computing total sales for each product line within each branch.

3. **Branch Sales by Date and Time Analysis**: [Link to Query on GitHub](https://github.com/Ayoub-Harimza/Supermarket-Analysis/blob/main/SQL%20Files/SQLQuery3.sql)
   - Examines sales data by date and time across branches, providing insights into sales patterns throughout the day.

Each query leverages SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to efficiently process the dataset and generate valuable insights for strategic decision-making within the supermarket chain.
# Data Visualization with Tableau
The data was visualized using Tableau. The interactive version of the dashboard can be found on [Tableau's website](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ayoub.harimza/viz/Book1_17083666690670/Dashboard1)

# Key Insights:

1. **Payment Method Preferences and Branch Performance**:
    - Cash transactions dominate in Branch C with 744 transactions, reflecting a preference for traditional payment methods.
    - eWallet transactions remain popular across all branches, indicating a growing trend towards digital payments.

2. **Product Line Distribution and Revenue Generation**:
   - Branch C dominates purchases of Electronic accessories, Fashion accessories, and Food and beverages, aligning with its higher total revenue compared to other branches. This indicates a strong correlation between product line distribution and revenue generation within each branch.

4. **Sales by Product Line**:
   - Food and beverages emerge as the highest revenue-generating product line across all branches, aligning with broader consumer preferences.
   - The dominance of certain product lines by specific branches, such as Electronic accessories, Fashion accessories, and Food and beverages by Branch C, highlights the correlation between product preferences and revenue generation.

3. **Hourly Sales Distribution by Weekday (Heatmap)**:
   - Weekdays exhibit peak sales during midday (12 PM to 2 PM) and early evening (5 PM to 7 PM), with variations across different weekdays.
   - Saturdays show distinct peaks in sales, especially during the late morning to early afternoon hours (10 AM to 2 PM), indicating higher foot traffic or weekend shopping patterns  That suggest different shopping behaviors and preferences throughout the week, which can inform staffing and promotional strategies or staffing adjustments to maximize sales potential.  

5. **Strategic Product Line Alignment for Revenue Optimization**:
   - Branch C's dominance in key product categories directly corresponds to its leading total revenue. To emulate this success, Branches A and B should prioritize aligning their product offerings with consumer preferences. This may involve conducting market research to identify trending or high-demand products and implementing targeted marketing strategies to increase visibility and sales. By optimizing product selection and promotion, Branches A and B can enhance revenue performance and better compete with Branch C.
