## Data Preprocessing 
In this project, I manipulated the supermarket dataset using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)in order to derive actionable insights into customer behavior, sales patterns, and payment trends across different branches. Below are the key steps undertaken in this analysis:

1. **Branch Sales Analysis**: [Link to Query on GitHub](https://github.com/Ayoub-Harimza/Supermarket-Analysis/blob/main/SQL%20Files/SQLQuery1.sql)
   - Calculates total sales, average sales per day, and the number of customers for each branch.

2. **Branch Product Analysis**: [Link to Query on GitHub](https://github.com/Ayoub-Harimza/Supermarket-Analysis/blob/main/SQL%20Files/SQLQuery2.sql)
   - Analyzes product sales distribution across branches, computing total sales for each product line within each branch.

3. **Branch Sales by Date and Time Analysis**: [Link to Query on GitHub](https://github.com/Ayoub-Harimza/Supermarket-Analysis/blob/main/SQL%20Files/SQLQuery3.sql)
   - Examines sales data by date and time across branches, providing insights into sales patterns throughout the day.

Each query leverages SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to efficiently process the dataset and generate valuable insights for strategic decision-making within the supermarket chain.
# Data Visualization with Tableau
The data was visualized using Tableau. The interactive version of the dashboard can be found on [Tableau's website](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ayoub.harimza/viz/QatarRealEstateAnalysis2020-2023/Dashboard1)
